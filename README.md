# deductive
Methods for deductive data correction and imputation

This R package is the next iteration of out [deducorrect](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deducorrect/index.html) package. The deductive package 

- integrates with our [validate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/validate/index.html) infrastructure for data validation
- performs better than `deducorrect`
- with a cleaner interface
